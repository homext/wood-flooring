Birch Solid Hardwood Flooring Sale Flooring Direct From saleflooringdirect.ie
Solid hardwood flooring prices are relatively higher than multi layer engineered flooring because of higher value. We have specials on prefinished hardwood flooring, unfinished flooring, solid hardwood, and engineered flooring. Our solid hardwood flooring planks are constructed from a single piece of 100% wood, made in the usa with the finest craftsmanship, and sourced mostly from the appalachian region (hardwood there is prized for its stability, consistent color and refined grain). Our real wood floors can be produced in a range of widths and finishes, depending on the hardwood species.
