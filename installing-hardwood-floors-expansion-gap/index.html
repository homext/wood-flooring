<p>By contrast, engineered hardwood flooring is designed to minimize many of solid hardwood's problems—such as gaps due to the expansion and contraction of the wood. Conversely, when air moisture levels decrease, moisture content evaporates, shrinkage occurs. The recommended expansion gap is a minimum of ¼ inch. But gapping in engineered hardwood still can occur.

<p>Nevertheless, even when using this method you need to remember to leave a 1.5 mm expansion gap wherever the engineered wood flooring meets a fixed object, so as to enable expansion and contraction. Expansion gaps should be left wherever the floor comes up against a fixed object, for example, next to a wall, a doorway or a heating pipe. Without these gaps, wood expansion will result to hardwood floor buckling, cupping, delamination or raised gains. Make sure you have them where your floor meets any vertical obstruction or where two expanses of flooring join and avoid possible buckling or squeaking of planks down the road.
