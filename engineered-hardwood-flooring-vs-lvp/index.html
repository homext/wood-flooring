<p>This type of flooring has a lifespan of about 20 to 40 years , depending on the wood and finish. Below we will break down the differences between real hardwood, engineered wood, and luxury vinyl plank, also known as lvp. While engineered hardwood floors lack the same qualities as the lvp floors, they are still a durable floor option compared to traditional hardwood floors. Engineered hardwood flooring can come in different thickness overall and vinyl planks can come in different plank styles (glue down, wpc and spc).
