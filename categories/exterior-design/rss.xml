      <title>Best Hardwood Floor And Planks With New Ideas</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Hardwood Floor And Planks With New Ideas&lt;/strong&gt;, Once installed, solid flooring tends to have tighter seams between boards. However, these days, hardwood planks come in various aesthetically pleasing designs and colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; src=&#34;https://homext.github.io/img/placeholder.svg&#34; data-src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.glossyfloors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/259.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Concrete Wood Floors&#34; title=&#34;Concrete Wood Floors&#34; onerror=&#34;this.onerror=null;this.src=&#39;https:\/\/homext.github.io\/img\/placeholder.svg&#39;;&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then we have had several areas where the individual planks seem to move. The problem is magnified if the boards were not tightly laid in the first place. After the grouping, install the first row of wood plank, making sure. Expect engineered wide plank flooring to start at a reasonable $4.00 to $6.00 per square foot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
