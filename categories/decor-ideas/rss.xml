&lt;p&gt;Starting with grit 40, then grit 60, and finally grit 100 is typically a good procedure for most wood floors. Sand the surface with a finer grit belt with the grain to smooth. So it is only right that i do an article about sanding wood floors with hand sanders. Then, you apply stain (or a coat of poly if you are going natural), then a coat of poly, then you buff the floors, so that you simultaneously smooth and scuff up the floors so that the next coat of poly will stick better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
