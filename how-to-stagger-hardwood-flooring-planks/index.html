Hardwood installers always stagger the ends of the boards in adjacent rows of flooring for two reasons. After cutting the first board, put the piece you have cut just now on the right side of the board. The number of planks required to cover the entire floor can be calculated by multiplying the width of the room by the width of the planks. The rule of thumb that professional flooring installers follow is to stagger the end joint of adjacent rows by a distance equal to 2 or 3 times the width of the plank.
