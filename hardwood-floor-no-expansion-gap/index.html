<p>This is a great fix for any narrow gaps that start to form in your flooring. Expansion gaps should be left wherever the floor comes up against a fixed object, for example, next to a wall, a doorway or a heating pipe.

<p>When this happens on a wood floor, if there is no space to allow for that expansion and contraction, the wood planks quite literally squeeze up against each other until they either bend outwards or rise upwards at the edges when it expands and then develops gaps when it contracts again. Since many of them are plywood style construction (cross grain layers glued together) they move in every direction, sometimes by large amounts in larger rooms. The size and the severity of the gap, however, will depend on several factors. Whenever hardwood flooring is being installed, an expansion gap of at least 12mm needs to be left around the perimeter of the room (including doorways). 19 Stylish Hardwood Floor Expansion Gap Unique Flooring.</p>

<p>Wood flooring expands and contracts due to variances in temperature and humidity. Although engineered hardwood floors can withstand changes in temperature and moisture better than solid wood floors , they still need an expansion gap to allow for small movements. This is a great fix for any narrow gaps that start to form in your flooring. There are many products you can use during this process, depending on how big the gaps are and what kind of installation youâve used, such as planking, nailing, or gluing.

<p>During the expansion process when warmer days allow for houses to be open to outside air, gapping will close up as the wood flooring takes on moisture and the filler eventually gets squeezed out. Proper moisture content in wood flooring and in the subfloor, along with adequate nailing, lets the flooring be installed without an expansion space. Years ago all that we had was solid wood floors and these boards have a mind of there own. Hence, fixing the gaps in an engineered hardwood floor isnât going to be much different than that of solid wood floors. Wood Flooring Expansion Gap wood flooring design.</p>

<p>By contrast, engineered hardwood flooring is designed to minimize many of solid hardwood's problemsâsuch as gaps due to the expansion and contraction of the wood. Expansion gaps should be left wherever the floor comes up against a fixed object, for example, next to a wall, a doorway or a heating pipe. The exact reason why engineered floors was introduced to the market to eliminate this problem. Nevertheless, even when using this method you need to remember to leave a 1.5 mm expansion gap wherever the engineered wood flooring meets a fixed object, so as to enable expansion and contraction.

<p>Although engineered hardwood floors can withstand changes in temperature and moisture better than solid wood floors , they still need an expansion gap to allow for small movements. In the absence of sufficient space to expand, i.e., the absence of an expansion gap, the floorboards will push up against each other. This allows the flooring to expand and contract naturally.
