<p>Floor joist blocking is taking solid lumber, typically the same size as your floor joists, and fastening pieces perpendicular between every pair of joists in a straight or staggered line. These are also very good over longer spans and since they have a low moisture content after production, they shrink very little and result in few loose fasteners and subsequent floor squeaking. Boise cascade and national lumber believe that this method can cut home energy costs. The flange permits a firm, comfortable, secure grip even when the joist is.

<p>Energy usage of the finished building can be reduced by routing ducts through engineered floor systems between the first and second floors. As a result, engineered floor joists are more costly than 2×10 timber, but they’re also considerably lighter and more straightforward to work with. No core voids and will not delaminate.

<p>Engineered wood is more sustainable, using less trees and costs less to use per square foot. Just as most builders would not try and use the minimum size allowed 2x joist to acheive a stiff floor, you should not push the limits of engineered joists.

<p>A common problem is using the span tables too literally. Its triangular webbing provides maximum space for the installation of mechanicals. This limits any modifications that may need to be done on the job site, for a variety of reasons. Floor joist stiffness has most to do with the span of the floor joist.
