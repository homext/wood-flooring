Janka Rating Chart From vintalicious.net
The janka hardness rating is a system designed to measure the relative hardness of wood. (who could imagine a wood species that is over three times harder than white oak?) This is done by testing the floor’s resistance by measuring how much pressure is needed to embed an 11.28 millimetre ballbearing halfway into the boards surface. The janka rating scale was created to rank the various degrees of hardness throughout the different species of hardwoods.

<p>The test measures the force required to push a steel ball with a diameter of 11.28 millimeters (0.444 inches) into the wood to a depth of half the ball’s diameter (the diameter was chosen to produce a circle with an area of 100 square millimeters). The higher the janka rating, the harder the timber is. The janka hardness scale starts at zero, with this option being the softest wood choice, making it easy to dent and scratch. Red oak, which has a janka rating of 1290, is the industry benchmark for comparing the relative hardness of different wood species.</p>
