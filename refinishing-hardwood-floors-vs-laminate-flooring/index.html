A Side By Side Comparison Bamboo and Wood Flooring From thespruce.com
The biggest difference between laminate vs wood flooring is the construction and material itself. Diy costs to redo and resurface wood floors yourself is $600 to $1,100. Refinishing hardwood stairs costs $25 to $85 per step. Laminate flooring is almost always installed in a floating application with the planks fitting together in a tongue and groove style, which makes a faster, easier installation than hardwood.
