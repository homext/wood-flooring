When comparing this type of wear layer with solid hardwood, that 6mm wear layer is the exact same for both types. To answer this question simply, the wear layer is basically the thickness of hardwood that sits on top of the multiply core of engineered wood flooring. Engineered flooring&#39;s wear layer can be as thin as 1mm and gets as thick as 5mm. We manufacture white oak wide plank engineered hardwood flooring, quarter sawn white oak wide plank engineered hardwood flooring, hickory wide plank engineered hardwood flooring it is constructed of one layer of 12mm or 15mm exterior grade birch.
